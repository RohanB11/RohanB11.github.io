We study how the abundances and activities of cellular components like DNA, mRNA, ribosomes, and protein are intrinsically related to one another, and how these relations govern emergent behavior like cell growth, survival, and response to environmental changes.

<b>Topics we are currently interested in:</b> <br>
a. coordination between transcription-translation fluxes<br>
b. protein homeostasis in starvation<br> 
c. resource allocation strategies during cellular response<br>
d. kinetics of ppGpp signaling
