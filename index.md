We study how the abundances and activities of cellular components like DNA, mRNA, ribosomes, and protein are intrinsically related to one another, and how these relations govern emergent behavior like cell growth, survival, and response to environmental changes.

<b>Some themes we are currently interested:</b>
coordination between transcription and translation fluxes
protein homeostasis during starvation
resource allocation strategies during cellular response
kinetics of ppGpp signaling
